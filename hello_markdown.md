# Hello Markdown !

It is **so** nice to be able to write in this simple format.

Once you get the hang of *it*, you just:

- Remember the basic syntax
- Write your doc
- Done !

Now you can be a Wiz at this language and code up stuff like `console.writeline("Hello Markdown !")`

Can't remember the language? No problem! Just visit one of these resources:
